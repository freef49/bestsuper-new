								<p><strong>About 1 in 5 self-employed Australian’s have no super. This is a problem; how do you retire with no super?</strong></p> 

								<p>You don’t.</p>

								<p>With 21.6% of self-employed Australians have no super only 7.2% of employees have no super. Digging deeper into the data the average super balance tends to be lower for the self-employed. The average employee between 55 and 59 is likely to have a super balance of almost $217,530 while a self-employed person of the same age has only around $110,110.</p>

								<p><strong>What’s going on? Why aren’t the self-employed paying attention to their super?</strong></p>

								<p>Charlie Viola, Partner of wealth management at Pitcher Partners, says, “Probably for long periods of time there’s been nothing to compel them to make super contributions, so they’ve tended to focus on the day-to-day, or reinvesting money into the business, and then rely on the sale of their business for their retirement nest egg,”</p>

								<p>“While that’s a viable strategy … there’s risk attached to that because they’re banking on that business doing well all the way through until they retire, and on the business actually being saleable.”, he notes.</p>

								<p><strong>Remember there are significant tax advantages to contributing to your super.</strong></p>

								<p>It’s important so have the discipline to put money into your super. It provides an immediate tax deduction, and it ensure forced savings.</p>

								<p>Money put into your super account is tax deductable as long as you’re not making more than 10% of your earnings from an employer. To be eligible for the deduction, you must fill out a notice of intent form (available from your super fund or the ATO) and send it in to your fund before doing your tax return.</p>

								<h2>Getting to the level of your employee peers</h2>

								<p>Most self-employed people under 50 can make tax-deductible super contributions of up to $30,000 a year. Those over 50 can pay $35,000 until next July when it drops to $25,000.</p>

								<p>If you choose to plough more into super, non-concessional super contributions are capped at $180,000 a year dropping to $100,000 a year next year</p>

								<p><strong>Moving forward</strong></p>

								<p>It hard to have the discipline to put regular small deposits into your super if our self-employed but this is the magic ingredient to super.</p> 

								<p>Being self-employed you should pay particular attention to insurances included in super policies, such as income protection insurance.</p>

								<p>It’s essential so that you’re not still working when your 85.</p>
