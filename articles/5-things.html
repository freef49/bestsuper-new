									<p>Once you read of this you’ll get a handle on most of the stuff you need to know about your super. </p>

									<h2>1.	You’ll have to wait till at least 55 to access your super</h2>

									<p>Once your money goes into your super it’s there for quite a while. There are exceptions to this but unless you need the money to pay for medical expenses or the bank is going to foreclose your house you’re not going to be able to access it.</p>

									<h2>2.	You will pay so much less in tax </h2>

									<p>Why put your money away till your old and grey? </p>

									<p>Because the highest rate of tax paid is 15% of the fund’s earnings, it some cases it can be as low as 0% (that’s right, you keep all of it).</p>

									<p>There are even tax breaks to encourage you to voluntarily contribute to your super that can be as high as 20% for a full time worker.</p>

									<p>If you can give up some of your earnings now it’ll make a big difference down the track!</p>

									<h2>3.	You choose the investments</h2>

									<p>There a loads of stories of people having lost money and while this can be the case it is generally only temporary.</p> 

									<p>Most super companies have packages where you can choose how risky you want your investments. Generally, the risker the option that you choose the greater reward over the long term. However, there are times when the market drops for a bit and then recovers a couple of years later.</p>

									<p>There is no reason that you couldn’t place all of your money in cash and term deposits for the tax breaks – do expect this to earn much money though.</p>

									<h2>4.	Consolidating is good</h2> 

									<p>Most people want to consolidate to save on fees and while this can make a big difference to someone with very little in their super it wont do much for most.</p>

								<figcaption class="article-image-bottom-margin">5 things to ponder about your super</figcaption>

									<p>Consolidating your super is good because you’ll have fewer funds to look after. This way when it comes to planning your super you’ll it’ll be much easier to make smart choices.</p>

									<h2>5.	You’ll regret not learning about your super earlier</h2>

									<p>Currently the amount of super that your employer must compulsory pay is 9.5% but that’s going up to 12% 1st of July 2022. This is such a large about of a person’s working wealth that it’s very important that this is taken care of.</p>

									<p>Once people retire that always wish that they had started to take of their super earlier</p>

									<p>Don’t be one of those people!</p> 

									<p>Contribute $5 to your super today, have the retirement you deserve!</p>
